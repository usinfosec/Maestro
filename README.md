# Maestro

[![Made with Maestro](docs/assets/made-with-maestro.svg)](https://github.com/pedramamini/Maestro)

> A unified, highly-responsive developer command center for managing your fleet of AI coding agents.

Maestro is a cross-platform desktop app for orchestrating your fleet of AI agents and projects. It's a high-velocity solution for hackers who are juggling multiple projects in parallel. Designed for power users who live on the keyboard and rarely touch the mouse.

Collaborate with AI to create detailed specification documents, then let Auto Run execute them automatically - each task in a fresh session with clean context. Run multiple agents in parallel with a Linear/Superhuman-level responsive interface. Currently supporting Claude Code with plans for additional agentic coding tools (OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Qwen3 Coder) based on user demand.

> **Note**: Maestro currently supports Claude Code only. Support for other agentic coding tools may be added in future releases based on community demand.

### Spec-Driven Workflow

Maestro enables a **specification-first approach** to AI-assisted development. Instead of ad-hoc prompting, you collaboratively build detailed specs with the AI, then execute them systematically:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. PLAN          2. SPECIFY         3. EXECUTE        4. REFINE   │
│  ─────────        ──────────         ─────────         ─────────   │
│  Discuss the      Create markdown    Auto Run works    Review       │
│  feature with     docs with task     through tasks,    results,     │
│  the AI agent     checklists in      fresh session     update specs │
│                   your Auto Run      per task          and repeat   │
│                   folder                                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this works:**
- **Deliberate planning** — Conversation forces you to think through requirements before coding
- **Documented specs** — Your markdown files become living documentation
- **Clean execution** — Each task runs in isolation with no context bleed
- **Iterative refinement** — Review, adjust specs, re-run—specs evolve with your understanding

**Example workflow:**

1. **Plan**: In the AI Terminal, discuss your feature: *"I want to add user authentication with OAuth support"*
2. **Specify**: Ask the AI to help create a spec: *"Create a markdown checklist for implementing this feature"*
3. **Save**: Copy the spec to your Auto Run folder (or have the AI write it directly)
4. **Execute**: Switch to Auto Run tab, select the doc, click Run—Maestro handles the rest
5. **Review**: Check the History tab for results, refine specs as needed

This approach mirrors methodologies like [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), but with a graphical interface, real-time AI collaboration, and multi-agent parallelism.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent** | A workspace tied to a project directory. Contains one Command Terminal and one AI Terminal with full conversation history. |
| **Group** | Organizational container for agents. Group by project, client, or workflow. |
| **AI Terminal** | The conversation interface with Claude Code. Supports `@` file mentions, slash commands, and image attachments. |
| **Command Terminal** | A PTY shell session for running commands directly. Tab completion for files, git branches, and command history. |
| **Session Explorer** | Browse all past conversations for an agent. Star, rename, search, and resume any previous session. |
| **Auto Run** | Automated task runner that processes markdown checklists. Spawns fresh AI sessions per task. |
| **Playbook** | A saved Auto Run configuration with document order, options, and settings for repeatable batch workflows. |
| **History** | Timestamped log of all actions (user commands, AI responses, Auto Run completions) with session links. |
| **Remote Control** | Web interface for mobile access. Local network or remote via Cloudflare tunnel. |
| **CLI** | Headless command-line tool for scripting, automation, and CI/CD integration. |

## UI Overview

Maestro features a three-panel layout:

- **Left Panel** - Agent list with grouping, filtering, search, bookmarks, and drag-and-drop organization
- **Main Panel** - Center workspace with two modes per agent:
  - **AI Terminal** - Converse with Claude Code. Supports multiple tabs/sessions, `@` file mentions, image attachments, slash commands, and draft auto-save.
  - **Command Terminal** - PTY shell with tab completion for files, branches, tags, and command history.
  - **Views**: Session Explorer, File Preview, Git Diffs, Git Logs
- **Right Panel** - Three tabs: File Explorer, History Viewer, and Auto Run

### Custom AI Commands

Create your own slash commands in **Settings > Custom AI Commands**. Each command has a trigger (e.g., `/deploy`) and a prompt that gets sent to the AI agent.

Commands support **template variables** that are automatically substituted at runtime:

#### Agent Variables
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{AGENT_NAME}}` | Agent name |
| `{{AGENT_PATH}}` | Agent home directory path (full path to project) |

## Auto Run

Auto Run is a file-system-based document runner that lets you batch-process tasks using AI agents. Select a folder containing markdown documents with task checkboxes, and Maestro will work through them one by one, spawning a fresh AI session for each task.

### Setting Up Auto Run

1. Navigate to the **Auto Run** tab in the right panel (`Cmd+Shift+1`)
2. Select a folder containing your markdown task documents
3. Each `.md` file becomes a selectable document

### Creating Tasks

Use markdown checkboxes in your documents:

```markdown
# Feature Implementation Plan

- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add unit tests for the login flow
- [ ] Update API documentation
```

**Tip**: Press `Cmd+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) to quickly insert a new checkbox at your cursor position.

### Running Single Documents

1. Select a document from the dropdown
2. Click the **Run** button (or the ▶ icon)
3. Customize the agent prompt if needed, then click **Go**

### Multi-Document Batch Runs

Auto Run supports running multiple documents in sequence:

1. Click **Run** to open the Batch Runner Modal
2. Click **+ Add Docs** to add more documents to the queue
3. Drag to reorder documents as needed
4. Configure options per document:
   - **Reset on Completion** - Uncheck all boxes when document completes (for repeatable tasks)
   - **Duplicate** - Add the same document multiple times
5. Enable **Loop Mode** to cycle back to the first document after completing the last
6. Click **Go** to start the batch run

### Playbooks

Save your batch configurations for reuse:

1. Configure your documents, order, and options
2. Click **Save as Playbook** and enter a name
3. Load saved playbooks from the **Load Playbook** dropdown
4. Update or discard changes to loaded playbooks

### Git Worktree Support

For parallel work without file conflicts:

1. Enable **Worktree** in the Batch Runner Modal
2. Specify a worktree path and branch name
3. Auto Run operates in the isolated worktree
4. Optionally create a PR when the batch completes

Without a worktree, Auto Run queues with other write operations to prevent conflicts.

### Progress Tracking

The runner will:
- Process tasks serially from top to bottom
- Skip documents with no unchecked tasks
- Show progress: "Document X of Y" and "Task X of Y"
- Mark tasks as complete (`- [x]`) when done
- Log each completion to the **History** panel

### Session Isolation

Each task executes in a completely fresh AI session with its own unique session ID. This provides:

- **Clean context** - No conversation history bleeding between tasks
- **Predictable behavior** - Tasks in looping playbooks execute identically each iteration
- **Independent execution** - The agent approaches each task without memory of previous work

This isolation is critical for playbooks with `Reset on Completion` documents that loop indefinitely. Without it, the AI might "remember" completing a task and skip re-execution on subsequent loops.

### History & Tracking

Each completed task is logged to the History panel with:
- **AUTO** label indicating automated execution
- **Session ID** pill (clickable to jump to that AI conversation)
- **Summary** of what the agent accomplished
- **Full response** viewable by clicking the entry

**Keyboard navigation in History**:
- `Up/Down Arrow` - Navigate entries
- `Enter` - View full response
- `Esc` - Close detail view and return to list

### Auto-Save

Documents auto-save after 5 seconds of inactivity, and immediately when switching documents. Full undo/redo support with `Cmd+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z`.

### Image Support

Paste images directly into your documents. Images are saved to an `images/` subfolder with relative paths for portability.

### Stopping the Runner

Click the **Stop** button at any time. The runner will:
- Complete the current task before stopping
- Preserve all completed work
- Allow you to resume later by clicking Run again

### Parallel Batches

You can run separate batch processes in different Maestro sessions simultaneously. Each session maintains its own independent batch state. With Git worktrees enabled, you can work on the main branch while Auto Run operates in an isolated worktree.

## Achievements

Maestro features a conductor-themed achievement system that tracks your cumulative Auto Run time. The focus is simple: **longest run wins**. As you accumulate Auto Run hours, you level up through 11 ranks inspired by the hierarchy of orchestral conductors.

### Conductor Ranks

| Level | Rank | Time Required | Example Conductor |
|:-----:|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Apprentice Conductor** | 15 minutes | Gustavo Dudamel (early career) |
| 2 | **Assistant Conductor** | 1 hour | Marin Alsop |
| 3 | **Associate Conductor** | 8 hours | Yannick Nézet-Séguin |
| 4 | **Resident Conductor** | 24 hours | Jaap van Zweden |
| 5 | **Principal Guest Conductor** | 1 week | Esa-Pekka Salonen |
| 6 | **Chief Conductor** | 30 days | Andris Nelsons |
| 7 | **Music Director** | 3 months | Sir Simon Rattle |
| 8 | **Maestro Emeritus** | 6 months | Bernard Haitink |
| 9 | **World Maestro** | 1 year | Kirill Petrenko |
| 10 | **Grand Maestro** | 5 years | Riccardo Muti |
| 11 | **Titan of the Baton** | 10 years | Leonard Bernstein |

### Reaching the Top

Since Auto Runs can execute in parallel across multiple Maestro sessions, achieving **Titan of the Baton** (Level 11) is technically feasible in less than 10 calendar years. Run 10 agents simultaneously with worktrees and you could theoretically hit that milestone in about a year of real time.

But let's be real—getting to Level 11 is going to take some serious hacking. You'll need a well-orchestrated fleet of agents running around the clock, carefully crafted playbooks that loop indefinitely, and the infrastructure to keep it all humming. It's the ultimate test of your Maestro skills.

The achievement panel shows your current rank, progress to the next level, and total accumulated time. Each rank includes flavor text and information about a legendary conductor who exemplifies that level of mastery.

## Command Line Interface

Maestro includes a CLI tool (`maestro-cli`) for managing agents and running playbooks from the command line, cron jobs, or CI/CD pipelines. The CLI requires Node.js (which you already have if you're using Claude Code).

### Installation

The CLI is bundled with Maestro as a JavaScript file. Create a shell wrapper to run it:

```bash
# macOS (after installing Maestro.app)
echo '#!/bin/bash\nnode "/Applications/Maestro.app/Contents/Resources/maestro-cli.js" "$@"' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli

# Linux (deb/rpm installs to /opt)
echo '#!/bin/bash\nnode "/opt/Maestro/resources/maestro-cli.js" "$@"' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator) - create a batch file
@"
@echo off
node "%ProgramFiles%\Maestro\resources\maestro-cli.js" %*
"@ | Out-File -FilePath "$env:ProgramFiles\Maestro\maestro-cli.cmd" -Encoding ASCII
```

Alternatively, run directly with Node.js:
```bash
node "/Applications/Maestro.app/Contents/Resources/maestro-cli.js" list groups
```

### Usage

```bash
# List all groups
maestro-cli list groups

# List all agents
maestro-cli list agents
maestro-cli list agents --group <group-id>

# Show agent details (history, usage stats, cost)
maestro-cli show agent <agent-id>

# List all playbooks (or filter by agent)
maestro-cli list playbooks
maestro-cli list playbooks --agent <agent-id>

# Show playbook details
maestro-cli show playbook <playbook-id>

# Run a playbook
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id>

# Dry run (shows what would be executed)
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --dry-run

# Run without writing to history
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --no-history

# Wait for agent if busy, with verbose output
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --wait --verbose

# Debug mode for troubleshooting
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --debug
```

### JSON Output

By default, commands output human-readable formatted text. Use `--json` for machine-parseable JSONL output:

```bash
# Human-readable output (default)
maestro-cli list groups
GROUPS (2)

  🎨  Frontend
      group-abc123
  ⚙️  Backend
      group-def456

# JSON output for scripting
maestro-cli list groups --json
{"type":"group","id":"group-abc123","name":"Frontend","emoji":"🎨","timestamp":...}
{"type":"group","id":"group-def456","name":"Backend","emoji":"⚙️","timestamp":...}

# Running a playbook with JSON streams events
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --json
{"type":"start","timestamp":...,"playbook":{...}}
{"type":"document_start","timestamp":...,"document":"tasks.md","taskCount":5}
{"type":"task_start","timestamp":...,"taskIndex":0}
{"type":"task_complete","timestamp":...,"success":true,"summary":"...","elapsedMs":8000}
{"type":"document_complete","timestamp":...,"tasksCompleted":5}
{"type":"complete","timestamp":...,"totalTasksCompleted":5,"totalElapsedMs":60000}
```

### Scheduling with Cron

```bash
# Run a playbook every hour (use --json for log parsing)
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --json >> /var/log/maestro.jsonl 2>&1
```

### Requirements

- Claude Code CLI must be installed and in PATH
- Maestro config files must exist (created automatically when you use the GUI)

## Configuration

Settings are stored in:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/maestro/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/maestro/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/maestro/`

## Remote Access

Maestro includes a built-in web server for mobile remote control:

1. **Automatic Security**: Web server runs on a random port with an auto-generated security token embedded in the URL
2. **QR Code Access**: Scan a QR code to connect instantly from your phone
3. **Global Access**: All sessions are accessible when the web interface is enabled - the security token protects access
4. **Remote Tunneling**: Access Maestro from anywhere via Cloudflare tunnel (requires `cloudflared` CLI)

### Mobile Web Interface

The mobile web interface provides:
- Real-time session monitoring and command input
- Device color scheme preference support (light/dark mode)
- Connection status indicator with automatic reconnection
- Offline queue for commands typed while disconnected
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Quick actions menu for the send button

### Local Access (Same Network)

1. Click the "OFFLINE" button in the header to enable the web interface
2. The button changes to "LIVE" and shows a QR code overlay
3. Scan the QR code or copy the secure URL to access from your phone on the same network

### Remote Access (Outside Your Network)

To access Maestro from outside your local network (e.g., on mobile data or from another location):

1. Install cloudflared: `brew install cloudflared` (macOS) or [download for other platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
2. Enable the web interface (OFFLINE → LIVE)
3. Toggle "Remote Access" in the Live overlay
4. A secure Cloudflare tunnel URL will be generated
5. Use the Local/Remote pill selector to switch between QR codes
6. The tunnel stays active as long as Maestro is running - no time limits, no account required
